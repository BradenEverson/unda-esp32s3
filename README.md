# Embedded ML on ESP32-S3 using Rust
## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

`rustup`
`cargo`
`cargo-generate` for scaffolding the project
`ESP-IDF` for the ESP32-S3 hardware abstraction layer
Serial drivers for the ESP32-S3 (depending on your OS)

## Quick Start
To create a new project based on this template, run:

```bash
cargo generate -BradenEverson/unda-esp32s3
```

Acknowledgements
This template is designed to provide a quick start for embedded ML projects on the ESP32-S3 using Rust. It is inspired by the efforts of the Rust and ESP-IDF communities to make embedded programming more accessible and efficient.
